## What I've learned
- using HTMLWebPackPlugin and including HTML template.
- PubSub pattern to decouple modules and separate concerns.
- Use of ES6 import/export.
- Use of .gitignore.
- Create multiple instances of Node elements rather than assign the same instance multiple times.
- Importance of indexes (as data attributes or values if select option)to match DOM elements to objects.
- Use of closest() method to target specific parent node, useful when clicking a node that has children nodes.
